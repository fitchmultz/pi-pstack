# Figure it out

Read [the Pi execution contract](../../docs/harness/pi.md). Use available authorized delegation or work inline, labeling lost independence; keep actual external gates and live-proof requirements.

When the task matches no playbook, design one. The deliverable before any code is the workflow itself: a sequence of phases that scales rigor to the task, runs the scientific method, and leaves a decision trail a human can audit after stepping away.

## Start

Track the phases below using an available task list, a task-owned file, or the conversation. First read the Principles section of the **poteto-mode** skill.

## Phase A: Frame

Ground first, then commit. Don't start the run until you can state:

- The definition of done as a falsifiable predicate (the **prove-it-works** principle skill).
- Scope, quantified: rough units and effort, plus the blockers grounding surfaced.
- The rigor level, biased high. One-way doors and high blast radius get more. Reversible low-stakes steps get less. Rigor is gates and artifacts, not "try harder".

Present the framing and material tradeoffs. Proceed under the user's existing authorization; stop for a user-owned decision or an explicit hold.

## Phase B: Design the workflow

Decompose into atomic, independently-landable units. Sequence riskiest-unknown-first. Scaffold and verification come before features (the **foundational-thinking** principle skill).

- Use an existing verification harness or build one when it answers a real task need. Capture a baseline where comparison matters.
- For unresolved, consequential design decisions, use the **architect** skill; retain an existing design that meets the requirements.
- Decide what can run independently. Give parallel writers separate worktrees or branches. When delegation is unavailable or forbidden, work serially and report the loss of independence.
- Write the designed phase list down. That list is what the human reviews.

Then execute the design. Track its concrete steps alongside Phase C and Phase D. Run each under the Phase C loop discipline, and weave the Phase D log through them, a row as each step lands, rather than saving the whole trail for the end.

## Phase C: Run the loop

Each unit is an experiment. State the hypothesis, make the smallest change, measure against the predicate on the real artifact, keep it if it advanced, revert it if it didn't. Apply the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, verifying each unit before starting the next instead of batching checks at the end.

- Verify by inspecting the artifact, never a self-report. When something passes too easily, suspect the observation method before the system.
- Use an independent judge when available, or perform the same checks yourself and label the result self-verified. A failed real gate is not a missing reviewer.
- A verdict is VERIFIED, NOT VERIFIED, or INCONCLUSIVE. Inconclusive is not a pass. Don't hide a negative.

## Phase D: Keep the audit trail

Log the run via the **show-me-your-work** skill. figure-it-out's work is usually ambitious enough to commit the trail so the reviewer can read it in the PR. The trail plus the diff is what lets the human come back and trust the work.

## Phase E: Verify and hand back

Check the whole against the Phase A predicate on the real product, not just the harness. Encode any recurring correction as a gate, a lint rule, a check, or a script (the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill).

**Reply:** the playbook you designed, the rigor level and why, the decision-trail path, what's verified against the predicate, and what's still open.
